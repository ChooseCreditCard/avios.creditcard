    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is Avios and How Do Credit Cards Fit In?</h2>
      <p>Avios is a points currency used by several airline and travel brands. Instead of earning separate miles for each airline, you collect Avios and then redeem them within a participating program for flights, upgrades, hotels or other travel rewards.</p>
      <p>Credit cards tied to Avios programs allow you to build balances faster by awarding Avios on everyday spending. Depending on the issuer and region, you may also earn Avios bonuses on specific categories such as travel, dining or foreign transactions.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How Avios Credit Cards Earn Points</h2>
      <p>Most Avios cards pay a base earn rate for all purchases, plus enhanced rates on selected categories. For example, you might earn more Avios on flights booked with a partner airline, on hotel stays, or when spending in foreign currencies.</p>
      <p>Introductory sign-up bonuses are common: reach a minimum spend within a set period and you receive a lump sum of Avios. Some cards also provide annual bonuses, companion vouchers or status-related benefits if you cross specific spending thresholds.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming -->
    <section id="redeeming" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Avios for Flights and Upgrades</h2>
      <p>Avios are typically redeemed for flights, cabin upgrades or part-payment on cash tickets. The number of Avios required depends on route distance, cabin class, peak vs. off-peak dates and which partner airline operates the flight.</p>
      <p>In many programs, long-haul business or premium economy redemptions can deliver significantly higher value per Avios than short-haul economy flights. However, taxes, fees and carrier-imposed surcharges still apply and can vary by route and airline.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Transfers & Partner Use -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Moving Avios Between Partner Programs</h2>
      <p>One distinctive feature of Avios is the ability, in many cases, to move points between participating brands’ accounts. This flexibility lets you consolidate balances where you see the best redemption opportunities, or shift Avios to align with a specific trip.</p>
      <p>Transfer rules, minimum amounts and supported directions depend on each program. Before moving Avios, it is wise to check whether redemptions you want are actually available in the target program, and whether any transfer limitations or delays could affect your plans.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & Considerations -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Key Factors That Impact the Value of Avios</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Route choice:</strong> Some routes and cabins give a much higher value per Avios than others.</li>
        <li><strong>Peak vs. off-peak:</strong> Award charts often charge fewer Avios on off-peak dates.</li>
        <li><strong>Fees & surcharges:</strong> “Taxes and fees” can make an Avios ticket less attractive on certain routes.</li>
        <li><strong>Expiry rules:</strong> Inactivity in your account may eventually cause Avios to expire, depending on the program.</li>
        <li><strong>Card fees:</strong> Annual fees and FX fees on the card itself affect net value from your Avios earnings.</li>
      </ul>
